Observations:

1. Akaze :
Akaze Descriptor only runs with Akaze Detector combination.

2. Sift:
Sift Detector doesnt run with Orb Descriptor Type.

3. Top 3 maximum matches found combinations:
	Maximum number of matched keypoits - 
		Fast Detector -  Brief Descriptor Type
		Fast Detector -  Orb Descriptor Type
		Fast Detector -  Sift Descriptor Type

4. All combinations with FAST Detector Type, irrespective of the Descriptor Type took (<3ms) for determining keypoints and also matching process.

5. Bottom 3 minimum matches found combinations:
	Minimum number of matched keypoints -
		Harris Corner Detector -  Brisk Descriptor Type
		Harris Corner Detector -  Freak Descriptor Type
		Harris Corner Detector -  Orb Descriptor Type

7. Brisk Detector Type took maximum amount of time to determine keypoints as compared to other detector types.

8. Looking at overall performnace the FAST detector type is the best one with below descriptor combinations. 
	Fast detector - Brief Descriptor
	Fast detector - Orb descriptor
	Fast detector - sift descriptor
	Fast detector - brisk descriptor
